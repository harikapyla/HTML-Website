              <p>This Theme was easy to install and configure. When I got stuck,
                I reached out to support and Alex provided super easy screenshots showing where
                to go to configure areas I wanted to modify. Fast and friendly support and a beautiful theme to work with. It was money 
                well spent (and way cheaper than comparable themes bought through shopify).</p><br><br>

           <p>Great support Alex!

              Shopify is a solid platform but once a theme is applied, the templates,
              assets, and liquid files can be changed and functions shuffled. Alex and Nova-Creative 
              are quick to respond and very efficient. Thanks again Alex.</p>
